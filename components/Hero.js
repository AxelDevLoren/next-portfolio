            I'm a high energy guy, always has been, always will. With that I
            tend to stay busy during the day, I wake up early drink some coffee
            and do some coding, by coding I mean I work on my own sites, review
            code or help some friends with their projects. When I get done with
            the "work", I always go to the gym to get some of that excess energy
            out of my body, after that I usually calm myself down with some
            videos or movies, with some food next to me.
